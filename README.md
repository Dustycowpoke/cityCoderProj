# cityCoder
Batch geocoder for excel address sheet using Google Maps API.

I made this to geocode 11,000+ water shut-off boxes for the Dept of Public Services in Madison Heights, MI. 

This was my first real project - I'd use pandas (and function wrappers) now to accomplish the same thing.

Shane Lynn's (https://www.shanelynn.ie/) python geocoder was invaluable in writing this.
