### Batch geocoder for addresses using Google Maps API and a simple Excel-based data structure

- I made this to geocode 11,000+ water shut-off boxes for the Dept of Public Services in Madison Heights, MI

- This was my first real project - I'd use pandas (and function wrappers) now to accomplish the same thing.

- [Shane Lynn's batch csv python geocoder](https://www.shanelynn.ie/batch-geocoding-in-python-with-google-geocoding-api/) was incredibly valuable in writing this.
