Batch geocoder based on address using Google Maps API

I made this to geocode 11,000+ water shut-off boxes for the Dept of Public Services in Madison Heights, MI. This was my first real python project so there are a lot of improvements that I'll puish as needed.

Shane Lynn's (https://www.shanelynn.ie/) python geocoder was invaluable in writing this.
